List    - is data type which contains multiple value 
        - mutable (value can be changed)
        - Member of List will be accessed by index
        - Member of list will be updated by index
        - Members can be any kind of data (int,float,None,boolean,string)
        - List is bundle of int,float,None,boolean and String
        - List is indentified by PVM by [] symbol
        - List is created by list() constructor
        - Index start from '0'
        - Python supports both way indexing (L -> R & R->L)
        - Index is always absolute
        - List contains other list as well 
        - List contains other object like - tuple, disctionary,set etc

List's functions
        - append(value) - add member at the end 
        - insert(index,value) - add member at given index
        - extend() - extending one list to another
        - copy() - copy member from one list to another
        - remove(value) - remove member from the list
        - len() - show the lenght of list
        - sum() - summation of int,float member
        - del  - delete the list
        - count(value) - no of occurence of the member 



C++, Java, C#
First Step - Variables / store only value at time
Array is also a variable - it stores multiple data, but data will homogenous 
                         - limited of the size (less data space will be utilized)
